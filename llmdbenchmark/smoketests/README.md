# llmdbenchmark.smoketests

Post-deployment validation for llm-d-benchmark. Runs automatically after standup and can be executed independently against an already-deployed stack.

## Why smoketests

Standing up an llm-d stack involves many moving parts -- Helm charts, init containers, sidecars, routing proxies, EPP pods, and scenario-specific vLLM flags. A successful `helm install` doesn't guarantee the pods are configured correctly. The smoketest module catches configuration drift, port mismatches, missing env vars, and broken routing before you spend GPU hours on a benchmark that was doomed from the start.

## Usage

```bash
# Run all smoketest steps against a deployed stack
llmdbenchmark --spec gpu smoketest -p my-namespace

# Run a specific step only
llmdbenchmark --spec gpu smoketest -p my-namespace -s 0   # health check only
llmdbenchmark --spec gpu smoketest -p my-namespace -s 1   # inference test only
llmdbenchmark --spec gpu smoketest -p my-namespace -s 2   # config validation only

# Dry-run (shows what would be checked, no cluster access)
llmdbenchmark --spec gpu smoketest -p my-namespace --dry-run
```

Smoketests also run automatically at the end of `llmdbenchmark standup`. Use `--skip-smoketest` to skip them.

## Steps

| Step | Name | What it does | Runs for |
|------|------|--------------|----------|
| 00 | `health_check` | Verifies pods are running, `/health` responds, `/v1/models` returns the expected model, service/gateway is reachable, pod IPs respond, OpenShift route works (if applicable). When both decode and prefill are configured, checks both pod groups. | All scenarios |
| 01 | `inference_test` | Sends a sample `/v1/completions` request (falls back to `/v1/chat/completions`), logs generated text and a copy-pasteable curl command for demo purposes | All scenarios |
| 02 | `validate_config` | Compares the live pod spec against the rendered `config.yaml` to catch mismatches in resources, parallelism, env vars, probes, volumes, security context, and vLLM flags | Scenarios with a dedicated validator |

Scenarios without a dedicated validator (cicd paths, sim, etc.) run steps 00 and 01 only. Step 02 logs a skip message and passes.

## Multi-Stack Smoketests

Smoketest steps are per-stack - each rendered stack (e.g. `qwen3-06b`,
`llama-31-8b`) runs through steps 00-02 independently. Two behaviors differ
from the standup and run phases:

- **Sequential execution.** Smoketest pins `max_parallel_stacks=1` regardless
  of `--parallel`. Parallel `/health` + `/v1/models` probes across stacks
  hammer a shared gateway unnecessarily and interleave logs in ways that make
  real failures hard to spot. Configured in `cli.py`'s `_do_smoketest`.
- **Per-stack gateway path prefix.** When a scenario uses a shared HTTPRoute
  (`httpRoute.mode: shared` in the scenario YAML), the smoketest inserts the
  stack's routing prefix into every gateway URL - e.g. `/qwen3-06b/health`
  and `/qwen3-06b/v1/models` - so requests actually reach this stack's
  InferencePool. Pod-direct-IP probes (which bypass the gateway) continue to
  hit `/health` and `/v1/models` without a prefix. The prefix is computed
  from `httpRoute.pathPrefix` by `compute_gateway_path_prefix` in
  `llmdbenchmark.utilities.endpoint`; scenarios that don't opt into shared
  HTTPRoute get `""` and the existing single-model behavior is unchanged.
- **Health-probe skip for narrowed routing.** If an operator sets
  `httpRoute.rewriteTo` to something other than `"/"` (e.g. `/v1`), the
  gateway intentionally doesn't route `/health` (which lives at vLLM's
  root, not under `/v1`). The smoketest detects this case via
  `_gateway_routes_health` and logs an INFO skip instead of failing -
  `/v1/models` + direct-pod-IP probes still run and still validate health.

## Step 00: Health check

The health check validates every layer of the serving stack:

- **Pod status** -- all model-serving pods are in Running state with ready containers. When both decode and prefill pods are configured (e.g. pd-disaggregation), both groups are checked independently. Logs explicitly distinguish "decode pod(s)" from "prefill pod(s)".
- **`/health` endpoint** -- the vLLM health endpoint returns 200
- **`/v1/models`** -- the models API returns the expected model name
- **Service test** -- the Kubernetes Service routes traffic to pods
- **Pod direct IP test** -- each pod responds on its direct IP (bypassing the Service)
- **OpenShift route test** -- if running on OpenShift, the external Route is reachable

## Step 01: Inference test

Sends a real inference request to validate end-to-end functionality:

1. Tries `/v1/completions` first with a short prompt
2. Falls back to `/v1/chat/completions` if the completions endpoint is not supported
3. Logs the generated text and a copy-pasteable `curl` command for demo and debugging purposes

## Step 02: Config validation

### How it works

The rendered `config.yaml` in the plan directory captures the exact configuration the scenario intended. Step 02 queries the live cluster for pod specs and compares them field by field. Nothing is hardcoded in the validators -- expected values come from the config, so they adapt automatically when the scenario changes.

The base class (`validate_role_pods`) handles the common checks that apply to every scenario. Per-scenario validators add checks specific to their deployment pattern.

### What the base checks cover

- Replica count matches config
- CPU/memory limits and requests
- DP_SIZE, DP_SIZE_LOCAL env vars match parallelism config
- Init containers present (preprocess, routing-proxy)
- Security context capabilities (IPC_LOCK, SYS_RAWIO, etc.)
- Routing proxy present or absent based on `routing.proxy.enabled`
- Volumes and volume mounts (dshm, shared-config, kubeconfig, etc.)
- Startup/liveness/readiness probe paths, thresholds, and periods
- vLLM command-line flags (enforce-eager, kv-transfer-config, block-size, max-model-len, etc.)
- VLLM_IS_DECODE / VLLM_IS_PREFILL role markers

### Registered validators

| Stack name | Validator | Scenario-specific checks |
|------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| `pd-disaggregation` | `PdDisaggregationValidator` | Both prefill + decode pods, KV transfer with NixlConnector, role markers |
| `precise-prefix-cache-routing` | `PrecisePrefixCacheAwareValidator` | No routing proxy, EPP pod running, `--prefix-caching-hash-algo sha256_cbor`, KV events port 5557 |
| `optimized-baseline` | `OptimizedBaselineValidator` | Decode-only, metrics port exposed, routing proxy present |
| `tiered-prefix-cache` | `TieredPrefixCacheValidator` | KV transfer with OffloadingConnector, LMCACHE env vars, `--max-num-seq`, EPP pod |
| `wide-ep` | `WideEpValidator` | LWS env vars (LWS_GROUP_SIZE, DP_SIZE_LOCAL), expert parallelism flags, RDMA network resource |
| `inference-scheduling-wva` | `OptimizedBaselineValidator` | Optimized-baseline checks; the WVA mixin adds its own when `wva.enabled` is true |
| `fast-model-actuation`, `fast-model-actuation-base`, `fast-model-actuation-keda` | `FmaValidator` | Launcher pods bound and not crashing, signature annotation, model ready, inference endpoint |
| `wva` | `WvaValidator` | Controller deployment up, HPA targets resolved and converged, KEDA CRDs present |
| `cpu-example` | `CpuValidator` | No GPU resources, CPU vLLM image, kubeconfig + preprocesses volumes |
| `gpu-example` | `GpuValidator` | GPU accelerator resource present, supports both modelservice and standalone |
| `spyre-example` | `SpyreValidator` | Spyre accelerator (`ibm.com/spyre_vf`), Spyre env vars (FLEX_COMPUTE, FLEX_DEVICE, etc.), precompiled model PVC, AIU image |

### The check system

Each validator produces `CheckResult` objects that track pass/fail status with details:

```python
CheckResult(
    name="replica_count",
    passed=True,
    expected="2",
    actual="2",
    message="Replica count matches config",
    group="decode",
)
```

Results are aggregated into a `SmoketestReport` that provides a summary (`passed_count/total checks passed`) and overall pass/fail status. Failed checks include expected vs. actual values for debugging.

## Running smoketests independently

```bash
# Against a deployed stack (uses the plan directory for config)
llmdbenchmark --spec gpu smoketest -p my-namespace

# Just the config validation step
llmdbenchmark --spec optimized-baseline smoketest -p my-namespace -s 2

# Just the health check
llmdbenchmark --spec pd-disaggregation smoketest -p my-namespace -s 0
```

Smoketests use the rendered plan directory from the workspace to find `config.yaml` and the stack paths. The workspace must exist from a prior `plan` or `standup` run.

## Adding a validator for a new scenario

1. Create `llmdbenchmark/smoketests/validators/<your_scenario>.py`
2. Subclass `BaseSmoketest`, override `run_config_validation(self, context, stack_path)`
3. Call `self.validate_role_pods()` for the standard checks, then add scenario-specific checks via `CheckResult`
4. Register in `validators/__init__.py` -- add the import and map the stack name to your class in `VALIDATORS`

The stack name is the `-name` field from the scenario YAML (e.g., `pd-disaggregation`, `cpu-example-ms`). When no validator is registered for a stack name, step 02 falls back to `BaseSmoketest` which skips config validation.
